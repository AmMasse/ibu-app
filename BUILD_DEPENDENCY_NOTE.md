# Build Dependency Note

The file `source/cmdline-tools.zip` was removed from version control because it exceeds GitHub's 100 MB file size limit. This file is required for building the Android app and must be manually downloaded or restored before running builds.

**Action Required:**
- Download the Android SDK command line tools and place them at `source/cmdline-tools.zip` before building or updating the app.
